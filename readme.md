This is an example style for [fdap-oidc](https://github.com/andrewbaxter/fdap-oidc).

Set [./static](./static) as `"static_dir"` in your `fdap-oidc` config to use it.

It should decently with most background images, so feel free to replace the image as you see fit.

If any designers have an urge to make this a more stylish default please do.
